# Salary-Prediction-System
The goal of this project is to predict salary on the basis of their experience.
This might be of great use for the HR department, where a candidate
comes and he tells his experience that how much experience he
had and on the basis of experience our system will predict what salary he
should get. We develop it with the help of Python, Machine Learning,
and Data Set.
There will be a Data Set in which we will have lot of data of actual employees.
This will have their experience and their actual salary, with the
help of linear regression. We will create a Machine Learning model.
Then we will also do some graphical representation for this. Graphically
we will plot graph using the mathplotlib library and see how our data
looks graphically. The main aim is predicting salary and making a suitable
user-friendly graph. It can produce an employeeâ€™s salary by clustering
and predict the salary through the graph. Using linear regression it
makes a graph. This graph helps to predict the salary for any positions
